        The Goblin Lord has taken over the world! For some inconcievable reason,
        the military has failed and it is up to you to save the world. The
        Goblin Lord has agreed to surrender should you best him and his army in
        a game of rock paper scissors. However, beware as things are not as
        simple as they seem. You must loot the goblin army in order to aquire
        gold to upgrade your rock, paper, and scissors for you to have an actual
        chance against the Goblin Lord.
